# Frontend

This folder wraps the Next.js app currently located at the repository root (src/, public/, next.config.js, etc.).

Phase 1 (non-disruptive): we keep code in place and provide scripts to run/build from here.
Phase 2 (optional): physically move src/, public/, configs into this folder after CI is adjusted.

Scripts reference the root package to avoid duplication.
