# Backend

This folder groups server code.

- netlify-bisonte-api/: Netlify Functions (production)
- api-server/: Express dev server for local/debug
- prisma/: ORMs, schema, seeds

Phase 1 (non-disruptive): keep code where it is; add helper scripts from here.
Phase 2 (optional): move code into backend/ with path updates.
